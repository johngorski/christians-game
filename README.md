# Christian's game from Junior High

Have fun!

And then let's have some fun porting it to
modern JavaScript and running it in a
browser. Can't always ask people to
scrounge up QBASIC 4.5 interpreters
when they could just load a web browser
instead, can you?

Some browser tabs which may be worth
opening:

* [HTML canvas pixel manipulation](https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Pixel_manipulation_with_canvas)
